Rustyweb
A simple tcp server written in Rust by John Serrano

To install, download the source and run "install.sh" as root. This will set up
the configuration files and compile the server. You will find the configuration
files in /etc/rustyweb. The server binary should be created in target/debug.

In a very minimalist way, this is a functioning web server, but there is still
much to do, including but not remotely limited to the following:
 - Index pages
 - Error pages
 - Handling requests which aren't get requests
 - Better (informative in any way) logging
