Rustyweb
A simple tcp server written in Rust by John Serrano

To install, download the source and run "install.sh" as root. This will set up
the configuration files and compile the server. You will find the configuration
files in /etc/rustyweb. To run the server, run "cargo run" in the root directory
of the program or execute the binary located in target/debug

This server currently serves web pages in response to GET requests, and utilizes
index pages and some error pages. The server is not compliant with the protocol
though such compatibility would be desirable in the future.

Very inexhaustive todo list:
 - HTTP compatibility
 - More error pages and detecting more diverse errors
