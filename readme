Rustyweb
A simple tcp server written in Rust by John Serrano

There should be a "rustyweb" directory in /etc/ containing a "rustyweb.conf"
file. rustyweb.conf is a json file with two fields: "port" and "path_to_files".
"port" contains the port number the server will run on. "path_to_files" contains
the location of the root dir which will be served. In the future, there will be
an install script which will handle this for you.

In a very minimalist way, this is a functioning web server, but there is still
much to do, including but not remotely limited to the following:
 - Index pages
 - Error pages
 - Handling requests which aren't get requests
 - Better (informative in any way) logging
